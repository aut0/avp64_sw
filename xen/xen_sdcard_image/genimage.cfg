# Minimal SD card image for the Wandboard
#
# The SD card must have at least 1 MB free at the beginning.
# U-Boot and its environment are dumped as is.
# A single root filesystem partition is required (Ext4 in this case).
#
# For details about the layout, see:
# http://wiki.wandboard.org/index.php/Boot-process
